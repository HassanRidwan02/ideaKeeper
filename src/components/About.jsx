        <h1>About IdeaKeeper</h1>

        <p>
          <strong>IdeaKeeper</strong> is a simple yet powerful web application
          designed to help individuals capture, organize, and revisit their
          ideas effortlessly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Great ideas often come unexpectedly; during a conversation, while
          working, or even in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, <br /> many of
          these ideas are lost because they are written in random places or not
          written down at all. <br /> IdeaKeeper was created to solve this exact problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Why IdeaKeeper Was Built</h2>
        <p>
          As a problem-solving frontend engineer, I constantly generate ideas
          project ideas, product ideas, and learning ideas <br /> but struggled to
          keep them in one reliable place. Notes were scattered across notebooks,
          apps, and documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          IdeaKeeper was built to provide clarity, organization, and focus, a
          single source of truth for ideas worth building.
        </p>
